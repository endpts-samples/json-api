# JSON API

This starter sample demonstrates how to create a simple JSON API with Node.js and [endpts.io](https://endpts.io)

## Local Development

> **NOTE:** Node 18.x or greater is required

To get started locally, install the dependencies and start the dev server:

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```

With the development server running, you can visit the endpoint in the browser: [http://localhost:3000/users/1](http://localhost:3000/users/1)

or call the endpoint with Curl:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/users/1
```

## Deploying to endpts.io

Deploy your project to the cloud with [endpts.io](https://dashboard.endpts.io) ([Deployment documentation](https://docs.endpts.io/core-concepts/deployments)).
